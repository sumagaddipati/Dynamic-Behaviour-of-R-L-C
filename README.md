# Dynamic-Behaviour-of-R-L-C
This Python program calculates Resistance (R), Inductance (L), and Capacitance (C) based on user-provided inputs. It takes values for resistor parameters (resistivity, length, area), inductor parameters (reactance, frequency), and capacitor parameters (plate area, distance between plates).
It takes parameters related to resistors, inductors, and capacitors and applies standard electrical formulas to calculate these values accurately.

**Features**

Computes Resistance (R) using resistivity, length, and area: R=(rho*L)/A
Computes Inductance (L) using reactance and frequency: XL/2*pi*f
Computes Capacitance (C) using plate area and distance: E0*A/D
Provides a user-friendly interface for input and output.

**Usage**

Run the Python script.
Enter the required parameters when prompted.
View the calculated values for Resistance, Inductance, and Capacitance.
