# Dynamic-Behaviour-of-R-L-C
This Python program calculates Resistance (R), Inductance (L), and Capacitance (C) based on user-provided inputs. It takes values for resistor parameters (resistivity, length, area), inductor parameters (reactance, frequency), and capacitor parameters (plate area, distance between plates).
